# Website_Game
In my Website Game project, I developed a Website Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which was made cross-browser compatible and responsive.
To create an engaging user experience, I used event listeners to trigger different actions, such as changing the ball's direction or spawning new obstacles.
Additionally, I implemented various collision detection algorithms to ensure accurate detection and prevent glitches. 
I created interactive user interface elements like a countdown timer or score counter, 
and I stored the game data in the cookie, retrieving it when the user returned to the game.
